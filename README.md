# MacWallpaperEngine

# mark1.py
first test notes:
  the background is animated but fps is low and file iteration is still buggy
  At the moment the only way to add a video is to name the file `test.mp4` and use the `getframes()` function which I should change on mark2
  
 # mark2.py 
 Changes:
    able to use videos straight off of youtube
    can specify what video in your files you want to upload
    less buggy and fps increased to 30fps(29.9 but due to cv2 not allowing for floats as attributes I have to stay on 30)
    will begin working on fps specific backgrounds
